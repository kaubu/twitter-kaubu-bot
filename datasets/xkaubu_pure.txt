Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.

Here is my interpretation of this.
If a 'papa' and a 'mama' have polite sex, that is, sex purely for the purpose of procreation, then a son is produced.
If they have romantic sex, that is, sex because they love each other, then they get a daughter.
If they have sex for the sake of sex, for carnal pleasure, they get 'lady boy'.
If instead two people have "free sex", a one night stand at a party, the baby becomes a poor dog.
If an 'Entertainer', such as, say, Michael Jackson, couples with someone during a party in a one night stand, a 'homo', that is, Latin for person, then an "Entertain Dog" is produced, a dog that will entertain people.
If two people have "Pay sex-Buy sex", that is, through prostitution or other means that use money for sex, then the offspring becomes a black rat.
If it was "more sexual", purely for the sake of sex, for carnal pleasure, then the offspring becomes a cockroach.
These black rats and cockroaches will enter the sewer, which is bad.
"Spirit can't return, Spirit disintegrates" - Because the spirit of the child cannot return to their human form, their spirit disintegrates, as it is no longer in the body of a human child, thus it cannot mature, and develop, with the mental faculties of a human, thus it truly embodies the animal.
The moral of this, is that only polite sex and romantic sex should be used. It is a propanda poster.

People are indeed born with different circumstances, with different sexes and races and skin colors and appearances, however, that does not mean that they deserve to be treated differently. For your analogy, it kind of doesn't apply since you need to be able to move about and shoot guns in a war zone, but that doesn't stop anyone else, such as women or minorities from being able to participate. Anyone can fire a gun, anyone can kill another human.
Just based on the start I can see you're basing your paper on the false assumption that 'feminism' is a singular movement, with one goal, but you're wrong. Surely there must be some feminists with their hearts in the right place right? There are of course radical feminists, but to lump them all together, to generalize an  entire group like that, it's eerily similar to the same assumptions radical feminists make about men, no?
Yes equality can be achieved, what world are you living in? Listen, let me put it in a language you can understand, a world where people are discriminated against based on the circumstances of their birth, completely outside of their control, is a SINFUL one, got it?
Not to say feminism means equality, we all know it's not, and that it's focused on women and girls' equality, meaning that feminism fundamentally can not achieve equality, but the notion remains, you see base feminism as radical because of your views.
The pursuit of equality is seen as radical by those who wish to oppose it

WTF ❗️❗️❗️!? please add a jumpscare warning next time
This is all ignoring the fact that it's still illegal to have sex with a minor as an adult, age of consent laws exist for a reason you know?
I think you fundamentally misunderstand consent as just making a choice rather than being mature enough to understand what the choice entails, and willing agreeing to it. Yes, children can make choices, but that doesn't mean they can consent. Children can not consent.
"Minors can consent to sex with adult." dude.... I don't even..... you even acknowledge that children are not mature enough to avoid being taken advantage of, and you're still saying that.
nd just because a child can make a choice doesn't mean they're old enough to understand what it means, like children can kill people on accident and not know what they did was wrong, and can similarly be taken advantage on due to their naivety and ignorance
I never said you did approve of it, I'm just saying that your logic approached condoning it bc in the context of the conversation an adult raped a minor, and you were saying minors are capable of making choices, basically implying minors can consent to sex with adults
You might want to back up a bit, your logic is sounding dangerously close to condoning pedophilia
Minors can't consent

Basically many countries such as my own (NZ) and the UK I believe have laws that say rape is either only unwanted penetration or unwanted penetration with a penis
The fact that they have to say "engaged in sex acts" "made love to" Etc when it's female teachers bc of the sexist law, when in fact it's rape, is horrible

kpop is really great and it gets a bad rep from the fans but really that's only the minority of the fan base as the majority of the fan base such as myself don't go out of our way to attack everyone who disagrees with our opinion but of course I'd defend my favorite kpop artists from any unjust slander and accusations but that doesn't mean that I'd actually go and send death threats because just like in all groups there will be extremists it's just that those extremists usually give the group in a broader sense a bad reputation which should not actually affect the majority which disagrees such as myself and yet this consistent belief consists that all kpop fans which are known as kpop stans now go out of their way to harass any single person who slightly disrespects any favorite artist but that's just not me or the rest of the fanbase so please don't associate us with them because we're not them, thanks :)

Yet again, it was an observation. I have not done that. YET again, you bring me into this, when you are the defendant.
So, tell me what it said
A gay furry would dismiss all of the opponents arguments and shift the attention again.
Search up "100 * 0^0" on google, or do it on any calculator
Lol you do realize 0⁰ = 1 right? 😂😂😂
I was making an observation at your puny attempts at getting the attention away from you. I had all the right as my intention was to expose you, not clear my status (like you do).
You just proved my point lmAOOOOOOO 😂😂😂
It's 100% BTW
That's something a gay furry would do. Say other people are gay furries to take the attention
100 × (0⁰) percent sure
no I am not. that's something a gay furry would say 🤔🤔🤔
incorrect
actually gay
Discord, you should add an account feature where you can pin servers you own, or are an administrator to on your profile, and add a join feature

"You think you can get away wit…
oh shit the triple threat is back out
You're lying to yourself by saying Stack isn't real
You're denying it again. Just accept it.
billion? you mean million right?
It is infact true. You'd deny it because it is, and you're embarrassed  about it. You're denying it now.
Stop denying it. You're at it again.
No my sentence ended with the full stop. You are deeply mistaken. Yes it's true,
nothing
Yes, it is.
No, you.
Since you're getting all defensive, it shows that you have something to hide. Stack is real.
WHAT??? NO. I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO HAVE AN AFFAIR ON @StephTheIDKWhat
