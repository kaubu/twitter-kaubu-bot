Yet again, it was an observation. I have not done that. YET again, you bring me into this, when you are the defendant.
So, tell me what it said

Search up "100 * 0^0" on google, or do it on any calculator
Lol you do realize 0⁰ = 1 right? 😂😂😂
I was making an observation at your puny attempts at getting the attention away from you. I had
You just proved my point lmAOOOOOOO 😂😂😂
It's 100% BTW

You're lying to yourself by saying Stack isn't real
You're denying it again. Just accept it.

Stop denying it. You're at it again.
No my sentence ended with the full stop. You are deeply mistaken. Yes it's true,
nothing
Yes, it is.
No, you.
Since you're getting all defensive, it shows that you have something to hide. Stack is real.
